# Epidemic Risk Forecast 2025–2026

Welcome to the **Disaster Intelligence Series**, a data-driven initiative aimed at forecasting and visualizing global disaster risks. This repository focuses on **epidemic outbreaks** by analyzing historical data, modeling future scenarios, and offering practical insights.

## 🌍 Overview

This project integrates predictive analytics, ARIMA time series modeling, and spatial insights to achieve the following objectives:

- Track historical epidemic trends (2000–2024)
- Forecast outbreaks from **July 2025 to December 2026**
- Profile high-risk countries by likelihood and impact
- Estimate potential death tolls and severity
- Recommend strategic responses

## 🔬 Key Deliverables

- 📊 Data Visualizations (trends, top countries, predicted deaths)
- 🌐 High-Risk Country Dashboard
- 📍 Geographic Map of Likely Epidemic Zones
- 📈 Time Series Forecast using ARIMA
- ✅ Recommendations for Agencies, Governments, NGOs

## 📈 Historical Trend Analysis

The chart below shows a long-term view of epidemic events from 2000 to 2024, with predictions through 2026:

### 🔍 Interpretation of Trendline (2000–2026)

- **Historical Decline (2000–2014):** A steady reduction in events from nearly 100 to under 20.
- **Stabilization (2015–2023):** Minor fluctuations around a low baseline.
- **Drop in 2024:** A sharp decrease to 2 events, suggesting reporting or surveillance shifts.
- **Forecast (2025–2026):** A consistent low frequency of 2–3 events/year, yet with heightened regional risk.
